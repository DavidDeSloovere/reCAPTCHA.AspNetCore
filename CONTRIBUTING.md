*First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!*

# Features

The purpose of this library is to create an inclusive environment for all .NET core developers. To put this in more simple terms. This means that feature requests must satisfy an important question.

1. Does this feature help multiple developers, or does it just help my project?

If a feature only helps your project. It will be rejected. If you can justify the existence of a feature by explaining how it will help all of us. Then it will be accepted!

# Bugs

Bug fixes will be audited to the best of my ability and merged when accepted. Depending on the changes needed to fix the bug. You might be required to update README.md with either an example, or fix to existing example. If a bug is created from a feature you added. You are encourged to fix the bug yourself. If you need help please place the help wanted tag, and @ me in the comments.
